# Testing and Verification Plan

Testing ensures each module functions independently and the integrated system meets the overall requirements. The following outlines the approach:

## 1. Unit Testing
- **Story Engine**: Validate parsing of story files, state transitions, and branching logic using automated tests (e.g., Jest).
- Ensure PDF conversion pipeline (Task 7.2) produces valid story files.
- **Character System**: Mock Inworld AI responses to test character dialogue flows and voice generation triggers.
- **Visual Generation**: Verify image/animation requests return correctly formatted results and caching works as expected.
- **Game Interface**: Test input parsing, command routing, and data persistence.
- Verify arrow key shortcuts work (Task 7.1).
- Confirm the dynamic map updates with each movement (Task 7.3).

## 2. Integration Testing
- Combine Story Engine and Character System to ensure characters respond accurately to story events.
- Add Visual Generation to confirm scene images match narrative context.
- Run the Game Interface with all modules to check end-to-end gameplay.

## 3. User Acceptance Testing
- Play through complete scenarios from each source text adventure to confirm the storyline remains consistent.
- Gather feedback on voice quality and visual appropriateness.

## 4. Performance & Reliability
- Measure response time for generating visuals and TTS audio on a local macOS system.
- Test reloading saved games to ensure state persistence works.

## 5. Continuous Verification
- Automated tests run via a simple npm script to maintain confidence as modules evolve.
- Document known issues and resolutions within each module's README.
