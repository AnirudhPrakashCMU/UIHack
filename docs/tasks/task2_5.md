# Task 2.5

## Description
Provide interface hooks so other modules can trigger character dialogue or actions through the Inworld SDK.

## Implementation Steps
1. Research existing open source projects that demonstrate connecting Node.js to Inworld AI. If suitable code is found, adapt it.


2. Create a `CharacterInterface` class that exposes methods such as `triggerDialogue` and `triggerAction`. The class should extend Node's `EventEmitter` so other modules can subscribe to these events.


3. For now, implement the methods to emit events and return the payload. Later these methods will call the real Inworld API.


4. Document the API in this repository so that the Story Engine or Game Interface can call these hooks.


5. Ensure no new dependencies conflict with the versions listed in `Stack.md`. The module uses only Node's builtâ€‘in `events` library, so no conflicts are expected.
