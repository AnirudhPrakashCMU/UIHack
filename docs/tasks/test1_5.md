# Test 1.5

## Goal
Verify completion of Task 1.5 by ensuring the story engine exposes an API to query scenes and submit player actions.

## Test Steps
1. Run `npm test` to execute Jest tests, including `test/storyEngine.test.js`.

2. Confirm all tests pass without errors.

3. Optionally run a Node.js REPL and require `StoryEngine` to manually step through `stories/example_story.json`.

4. Check `docs/Stack.md` to verify no dependency conflicts (currently Node.js 20.19.2 and jest 30.0.0).


No conflicts were found while implementing this task.
