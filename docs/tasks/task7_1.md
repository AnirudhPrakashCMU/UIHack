# Task 7.1

## Description
Add keyboard shortcuts so players can use arrow keys instead of clicking buttons to move in cardinal directions.

## Implementation Steps
1. Research open source libraries for capturing key events in browser-based games.

2. Map the arrow keys to `go north`, `go south`, `go east`, and `go west` commands.

3. Update the web interface to listen for these keys and trigger the corresponding actions.

4. Ensure the existing button-based controls continue to work for accessibility.

5. Note: Look for existing code if possible.
