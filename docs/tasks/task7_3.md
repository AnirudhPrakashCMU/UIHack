# Task 7.3

## Description
Generate a dynamic map that traces the player's movements during gameplay.
The map should update in real time as arrow keys or directional choices are used.

## Implementation Steps
1. Replace the static map image with an HTML5 canvas element.
2. Maintain a path of coordinates in the browser representing the player's steps.
3. Draw line segments on the canvas to visualize the path whenever the player moves.
4. Bind movement actions (arrow keys and direction buttons) to update the path.
5. Ensure the map stays visible in the bottom-right corner of the interface.
