In theory, it’s supposed \nto be electrified twenty-four hours a day as a deterrent to \nthe predators that live in the woods — packs of wild \ndogs, lone cougars, bears — that used to threaten our \nstreets. But since we’re lucky to get two or three hours of \nelectricity in the evenings, it’s usually safe to touch. Even \nso, I always take a moment to listen carefully for the \nhum that means the fence is live. Right now, it’s silent as \na stone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out on \nmy belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that’s been \nloose for years.

Then they pull me from the table, removing the thin \nrobe I’ve been allowed to wear off and on. I stand there, \ncompletely naked, as the three circle me, wielding \ntweezers to remove any last bits of hair. I know I should \nbe embarrassed, but they’re so unlike people that I’m no \nmore self-conscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds \nwere pecking around my feet.",

The \ncameras will turn to them when the crowd is reacting to \ntheir handiwork. A large balcony off a building to the \nright has been reserved for the Game-makers. Television \ncrews have claimed most of the other balconies. But the \nCity Circle and the avenues that feed into it are \ncompletely packed with people. Standing room only. At \nhomes and community halls around the country, every \ntelevision set is turned on. Every citizen of Panem is \ntuned in. There will be no blackouts tonight. \nCaesar Flickerman, the man who has hosted the \ninterviews for more than forty years, bounces onto the \nstage.

You’re \nneither of you up to the blood bath at the Cornucopia. \nJust clear out, put as much distance as you can between \nyourselves and the others, and find a source of water,”",

With each \nbottle I pour over him, the worse the wound looks. The \nrest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just one \ntracker jacker sting and a few small burns that I treat \nquickly.

It was a Friday evening, the day before \nPrim’s tenth birthday in late May. As soon as school \nended, Gale and I hit the woods, because I wanted to get \nenough to trade for a present for Prim. Maybe some new \ncloth for a dress or a hairbrush. Our snares had done well \nenough and the woods were flush with greens, but this \nwas really no more than our average Friday-night haul. I \nwas disappointed as we headed back, even though Gale \nsaid we’d be sure to do better tomorrow. We were resting \na moment by a stream when we saw him. A young buck, \nprobably a yearling by his size. His antlers were just \ngrowing in, still small and coated in velvet. Poised to run \nbut unsure of us, unfamiliar with humans. Beautiful. \nLess beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught him, \none in the neck, the other in the chest. Gale and I had \nshot at the same time. The buck tried to run but \nstumbled, and Gale’s knife slit his throat before he knew \nwhat had happened. Momentarily, I’d felt a pang at \nkilling something so fresh and innocent. And then my",

Greasy Sae had \nintervened and sent us with our deer to the butcher, but \nnot before it’d been badly damaged, hunks of meat \ntaken, the hide riddled with holes. Although everybody \npaid up fairly, it had lowered the value of the kill. \nThis time, we waited until dark fell and slipped under a \nhole in the fence close to the butcher. Even though we \nwere known hunters, it wouldn’t have been good to go \ncarrying a 150-pound deer through the streets of District \n12 in daylight like we were rubbing it in the officials’ \nfaces. \nThe butcher, a short, chunky woman named Rooba, \ncame to the back door when we knocked.

The night when you \nshouted out his name from that tree,” says Caesar. \nThank you, Caesar! I think, and then go with his idea. \n“Yes, I guess that was it. I mean, until that point, I just \ntried not to think about what my feelings might be, \nhonestly, because it was so confusing and it only made \nthings worse if I actually cared about him. But then, in \nthe tree, everything changed,” I say. \n“Why do you think that was?” urges Caesar. \n“Maybe . . . because for the first time . . . there was a \nchance I could keep him,” I say. \nBehind a cameraman, I see Haymitch give a sort of huff \nwith relief and I know I’ve said the right thing. Caesar \npulls out a handkerchief and has to take a moment \nbecause he’s so moved. I can feel Peeta press his \nforehead into my temple and he asks, “So now that \nyou’ve got me, what are you going to do with me?”",

But it’s not until we get around to the mutts \nthat I forget I’m on camera. When Caesar asks Peeta \nhow his “new leg” is working out. \n“New leg?” I say, and I can’t help reaching out and \npulling up the bottom of Peeta’s pants. “Oh, no,” I \nwhisper, taking in the metal-and-plastic device that has \nreplaced his flesh. \n“No one told you?” asks Caesar gently. I shake my head. \n“I haven’t had the chance,” says Peeta with a slight \nshrug. \n“It’s my fault,” I say. “Because I used that tourniquet.” \n“Yes, it’s your fault I’m alive,” says Peeta. \n“He’s right,” says Caesar. “He’d have bled to death for \nsure without it.”",

In \nfact, he pretty much leaves me alone until the berries \ncome up. \n“Katniss, I know you’ve had a shock, but I’ve got to ask. \nThe moment when you pulled out those berries. What \nwas going on in your mind . . . hm?” he says. \nI take a long pause before I answer, trying to collect my \nthoughts.
